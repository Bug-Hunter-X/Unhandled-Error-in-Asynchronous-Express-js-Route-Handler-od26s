# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications using Express.js: unhandled errors within asynchronous route handlers.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where an asynchronous operation might throw an error, causing the server to crash without proper error handling. The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using error handling to gracefully manage this scenario, preventing server crashes and ensuring application stability.  This is a crucial aspect of building robust and reliable Node.js applications.
